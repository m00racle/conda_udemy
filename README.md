# conda_udemy
trial repo for the udemy machine learning course.

This is a conda project thus make sure to install all the package requiremnets from the environment.yml file.

If you already install the packages just to be safe update using the environment.yml file

conda env update --file environment.yml --prune

when you added a package to the project you need to export the latest environment to the environment.yml file:
conda env export > environment.yml

Good Luck
